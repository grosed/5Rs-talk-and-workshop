## First Working Paper
Paper title: Active Change-Point Detection

Paper Authors: Shogo Hayashi, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Hisashi Kashima

### Progress update

* Have read the paper to see if the paper is feasible.
* Have found a Python file (acpd.py) with functions that seem to do what the paper does.
* Have found what appears to be the data.

### Current challenges

* There is a package imported in acpd.py that imports a package we can't find (change_point_detection.cpd or change_point_detection)
