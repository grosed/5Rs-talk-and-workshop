## First Working Paper
Paper title: Active Change-Point Detection

Paper Authors: Shogo Hayashi, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Hisashi Kashima

### Progress update

* Have read the paper to see if the paper is feasible.
* Have found a Python file (acpd.py) with functions that seem to do what the paper does.
* Have found what appears to be the data.
* 

### Current challenges

* There is a package imported in acpd.py that imports a package we can't find (change_point_detection.cpd or change_point_detection).
* They reference a change point detection method by Kou et al. 2006.
* Kou has a GitHub with R code that uses the average difference method.

### Actions taken

* The lead Author has left the university however has email on the repository (https://github.com/empor10alnho/acpd). Have tried to contact him by this method.
